## Contributing to Shoresh (sefaria-tutor)

Thank you for considering contributing to Shoresh. Contributions are welcome via issues, pull requests, or discussions.

This document explains:

- **how to contribute**, and
- **what rights you grant when you contribute**, so that we can legally run a hosted service and ship mobile apps, including proprietary add-ons.

## How to contribute

- **Bug reports / feature requests**: Open a GitHub issue describing the problem or idea as clearly as possible.
- **Small fixes** (docs, typos, minor code changes): Open a pull request; no prior discussion required.
- **Larger changes** (new features, refactors, behavior changes): Please open an issue first so we can discuss design and scope.

When submitting a pull request:

- Keep changes focused and reasonably small.
- Add or update tests when appropriate.
- Update documentation or comments if behavior changes.

## Contributor License Grant (CLA-style terms)

By submitting a contribution to this repository (for example, by opening a pull request and having it merged), **you agree to the following**:

1. **You keep your copyright**
   - You retain ownership of the copyright in your contributions.

2. **You grant a broad license to the project maintainers**
   - You grant **Cogitations, LLC and Irv Shapiro** a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, irrevocable license to:
     - use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of your contribution;
     - distribute your contribution and derivative works;
     - **sublicense** these rights to third parties; and
     - incorporate your contribution into:
       - **proprietary or closed‑source add‑ons** for the hosted Shoresh service, and
       - **proprietary or closed‑source versions** of Shoresh, including but not limited to **mobile applications**.

3. **No additional permission required later**
   - Once your contribution is merged, the above license is sufficient for the maintainers to reuse your contribution in:
     - the BSL-licensed project and, after the Change Date, the CPAL-licensed project,
     - a hosted/managed service, and
     - proprietary add‑ons or mobile apps,
     without needing to ask you for any further permissions.

4. **Your responsibility**
   - You confirm that you have the right to grant this license (for example, that your employer or other parties do not own the contribution in a way that would prevent you from contributing it under these terms).

If you cannot or do not wish to grant these rights, **please do not submit code contributions**. You are still welcome to open issues, request features, or suggest ideas.
