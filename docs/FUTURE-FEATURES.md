# Future Features & Product Roadmap

This document outlines potential features to enhance Soresh for high school students in Jewish day schools, focusing on bridging the gap between basic translation and textual mastery.

## 1. Student Mastery & Vocabulary Building
*Focus: Building independent learning skills (lekshir).*

*   **Personal "My Dictionary":** A "Save to My Words" button in the translation table. Users can manage a personalized list of words and export them to flashcard apps like Anki or Quizlet.
*   **Root (Shoresh) Explorer:** A dedicated view grouping words by their lexical root. This helps students see how the same root (e.g., א-מ-ר) transforms across different texts and contexts.
*   **Interactive Verb Conjugator:** A visual table showing the full Binyan (conjugation pattern) for a selected verb root, helping students internalize prefix/suffix systems.

## 2. Classroom & Teacher Integration
*Focus: Supporting the teacher-student relationship and classroom workflows.*

*   **"Teacher's Choice" Pinned Texts:** Allows teachers (Team leaders) to pin specific chapters or verses as assignments. Students see these "Current Assignments" upon login.
*   **Progress Dashboard:** Anonymized statistics for teachers to see which words or grammatical concepts students are looking up most frequently, allowing for data-driven lesson planning.
*   **Shared Notes (Chavrusa Mode):** Real-time collaborative study where two students can link sessions to see each other's notes and lookups.

## 3. Deep Textual Analysis Tools
*Focus: Moving beyond plain meaning (Peshat) into analysis.*

*   **Commentary Layering:** Integration with Sefaria's Link API to show Rashi, Ramban, or Onkelos for a specific verse. AI can be used to summarize complex commentaries into simpler English.
*   **Trope (Ta'amim) Explainer:** Explanation of the grammatical function of cantillation marks (e.g., identifying "Mafsik" or separators) to aid in sentence structure understanding.
*   **Gemara Logical Mapping:** AI-powered identification of the logical flow of Gemara (Question, Answer, Proof, Refutation) to help students visualize complex Aramaic arguments.

## 4. Self-Assessment & Gamification
*Focus: Engagement and retention.*

*   **AI-Generated Quizzes:** A "Quiz Me" button that generates 5-10 multiple-choice questions based on the vocabulary and grammar of the text currently being studied.
*   **Streak & Mastery Badges:** Achievement system for consistency (e.g., "7-day study streak") or specific milestones (e.g., "Shoresh Seeker" for finding 10 words with the same root).

## 5. Accessibility & Fluency
*Focus: Supporting diverse learning needs.*

*   **Smart Transliteration:** A toggle to show phonetic transliteration for Hebrew/Aramaic phrases to support students building reading fluency.
*   **Audio Recording & Comparison:** Allow students to record themselves reading a verse and play it back alongside the AI's TTS for pronunciation practice.

## Priority Recommendations
1.  **Personal Vocabulary List:** High impact for daily homework.
2.  **Teacher Dashboard:** Critical for school-wide adoption.
3.  **Commentary Layering:** Essential for moving to higher-level study.
