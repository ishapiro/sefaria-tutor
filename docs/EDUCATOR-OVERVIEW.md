# Shoresh: Empowering Independent Learning of Jewish Texts
## A Guide for Jewish Educators

### Overview
Shoresh is an AI-powered study companion designed to help students transition from basic reading to independent textual mastery (*lekshir*). By combining the vast library of **Sefaria** with advanced Large Language Models, the app provides a personalized, word-by-word bridge to the original Hebrew and Aramaic sources.

### Current Features (Available Now)
The following features are currently live and ready for use in the classroom or for independent study:

*   **Full Sefaria Library Access:** Seamlessly browse Tanakh, Talmud, Liturgy, and more through a clean, modern interface.
*   **Contextual AI Translation:** Unlike generic translators, our AI is prompted as a "Torah Teacher," providing translations that respect the nuances of Jewish thought.
*   **Word-by-Word Grammatical Analysis:** Click any phrase to see a detailed breakdown of every word, including:
    *   **Shoresh (Root):** Identification of the lexical root.
    *   **Binyan:** Verb conjugation patterns (e.g., Pa'al, Piel).
    *   **Grammar Notes:** Explanations of prefixes, suffixes, and tense.
*   **Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS):** 
    *   Listen to a full phrase to master the flow of the sentence.
    *   Click individual words to hear precise Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation.
    *   **Consistent Male-Sounding Voice:** All audio uses a single, clear male voice so students get used to one accent and pacing.
*   **Pronunciation Cache (Performance & Cost Control):**
    *   Frequently used words and phrases are cached on the server, so audio playback is fast and responsive even on school Wi‑Fi.
    *   An admin‑only dashboard lets school IT or lead teachers monitor cache size and purge old items if needed.
*   **Admin-Configurable Default Model:** Admins can select the GPT model used for translations system-wide (e.g., gpt-5.1-chat-latest for speed). A speed-test tool lets admins compare model response times.
*   **Smart Translation Cache / Dictionary:** A community-driven "Dictionary" that remembers previously looked-up phrases, ensuring speed and consistency. Educators can encourage students to re-use “canonical” translations for key pesukim and sugyot.
*   **Google & Email Authentication:** Secure accounts for students to manage their study sessions.
*   **Role-Based Access (Student / Teacher / Admin):**
    *   Admin users can manage accounts (promote to teacher, disable or restore accounts).
    *   Future features will key off these roles to expose teacher-only views and reporting.

### Product Roadmap (Upcoming Features)
We are actively developing features to support the specific needs of Jewish Day Schools and High Schools. The items below are especially aimed at grades 8–12, where students are transitioning from “reading along” to owning the text themselves.

#### 1. Student Skill Building
*   **Personalized Vocabulary Lists:** Students can save "trouble words" to a personal dictionary for review over time.
*   **Anki/Quizlet Export:** Turn saved words into flashcards with one click for homework or test prep.
*   **Root Explorer:** A visual tool to track how a single *shoresh* appears across different genres of text.
*   **Level-Appropriate Difficulty Settings (Planned):**
    *   Teachers will be able to choose how much grammatical detail is shown (e.g., “Basic,” “Standard,” “Advanced”) so that a 9th‑grade Chumash class doesn’t see the same density of information as a 12th‑grade Gemara shiur.
    *   Options to hide the English translation initially so students must attempt the phrase on their own before revealing it.

#### 2. Teacher & Classroom Tools
*   **Teacher Dashboards:** Leaders can view anonymized data on which verses or words their class is finding difficult, allowing for more focused lesson planning.
*   **Pinned Assignments:** Teachers can create "Direct Links" to specific chapters, so students land exactly where they need to study (ideal for homework: “Open Shoresh and go directly to Bereshit 12:1–3”).
*   **Chavrusa Mode (Planned):** Collaborative digital study where students can share notes and lookups in real-time—useful for paired chevruta work in a high‑school Beit Midrash.
*   **Admin & Roster Management (In Progress):**
    *   Admin users can create and manage accounts, restore accidentally deleted users, and ensure only verified students have access.
    *   This is designed to align with school IT expectations around account lifecycle and security.

#### 3. Advanced Analysis
*   **Commentary Layering:** Instant access to Rashi and Ramban, with AI-powered simplification of complex medieval Hebrew.
*   **Gemara Logic Mapping:** Visual guides to identify the *Kal Va-Chomer*, *Kushya*, and *Teretz* within the Gemara’s flow—helping students see the “shape” of a sugya.
*   **Trope Explainer:** Identifying the grammatical function of *Ta'amim* (cantillation marks) to help students parse the structure of Tanakh verses.
*   **Assessment-Friendly Views (Planned):**
    *   “Exam Mode” that temporarily hides AI aids (translation and grammar hints) so teachers can use the same interface during closed-book assessments.
    *   Printable or exportable snapshots of a passage with or without word-by-word help, for quizzes and take‑home assessments.

### Why Use Shoresh?
*   **Promotes Independence:** Students no longer get "stuck" on a single word; they have the tools to move forward on their own.
*   **Focuses on Grammar:** We don't just give the answer; we explain *why* the word means what it does by showing the root and structure.
*   **Free for All:** This project is provided free of charge to support the growth of Torah study worldwide.
